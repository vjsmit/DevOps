Steps to install Jenkins:

1) Jenkins is a Java application, so the first step is to install Java. 
    sudo yum install java -y 

2) The next step is to enable the Jenkins repository:

    $ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
    
3) And add the repository to your system with:

    $ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
    
4) Once the repository is enabled, install the latest stable version of Jenkins by typing:
    $ sudo yum install jenkins -y 
    
5) After the installation process is completed, start the Jenkins service with:
    $ sudo systemctl start jenkins
    
6) To check whether it started successfully run:
    $ systemctl status jenkins
    
7)  Finally enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot:
    $ sudo systemctl enable jenkins
